Original workshop guide, written for a satellite kids workshop at Scratch Europe 2019 (Cambridge). 
This takes kids as far as exporting their sprites to files.

[DoodleSprite_Costumes.pdf](DoodleSprite_Costumes.pdf)

A re-write / expansion of the pose creation & export sections of the original, with additional
instruction added covering the importing of the export files created into a Scratch game.

NOTE: doodle-sprite.pdf still needs to be edited to remove this content, amend its introductory 
goals and provide a new concluding section to show the finished product 
(an image of the final character graphic - costume/pose 1).

Useful emergency replacement material for kids who have put lots of effort into creating and exporting 
their costumes but have failed somehow in their output files - simply swap these in and get them moving 
on to the Scratch import part of the task.

[Example_Maze_Game.sb2](Example_Maze_Game.sb2)

A fully playable maze game that can be used as a template to replace the main character with the 
sprite costumes created. Kids can, of course, choose to use their own game for this part of the task. 
This is here for those kids that don't have such a game to modify.

NOTE: there are different modes to this game that include enemies and a set of gun sights to avoid 
but no death logic has been coded up yet. This fact can be used as an extension task for kids that 
finish the sprite replacement task early. Just ask them to figure out how to make the main character 
die when they touch the enemy or the gun sights.
